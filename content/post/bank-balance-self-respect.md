After ending up in clinical depression during my JEE prep, everyone in my life treated me like a criminal, failure, loser. I'm sure I'm not alone in being treated this way for not passing an exam. But what is has done to me is still devastating for me even now.

Everyone was so sure that I'll end up with nothing in life, that many cut ties, and remaining used to insult on face. Again, I'm not unique in facing this, and people go through worse. But the trauma it has contributed to my life, couldn't be undone even after 4 years.

Fortunately, after a lot of efforts, when I finally made it out and 'proved' myself to the 'society', starting right from my home, people were suddenly back in my life. There's a lot to share, but the point that I wanna highlight here is about money.

Since I had (have) no college degree, the only metric used to measure my success was (and still is) how much money I make. People from my family and hometown still can't wrap their head around how I make more money that their households including their IIT graduate son.

Sounds great flex, right? What it has done to me is I live in constant fear of losing everything in a whiplash. Like a sword hanging above me, waiting to drop for one wrong move that I make. It's like everything I've built until now could get wiped off in moments.

As my psych rightly said, "Since you're being respected only for your money, & the only reason you feel you're making it because of your Twitter presence, you live in dear of what if I lose my Twitter tomorrow, which very unlike a degree won't stay with me."

It's very easy for people to say "dropping out is cool" and "it must've been fun skipping college" But the combination of middle class background + once being recognised as a loser + making it out successfully + success being judged by bank balance is a poisonous combination

I know the current people in my life won't let me sleep hungry no matter what, but the fear of just being on your own haunts sometimes. Sometimes there's a void where you're looking for help and you're left stranded.

Unfortunately, the only solution out of this seems more money thus trapping you in a loop. And I'm not even talking about the inferiority complex caused by being surrounded by people who are legit wealthy.

On one side there are people in your hometown scratching their heads over how tf am I even employed without a degree let alone making good money. And on the other side you're surrounded by people carrying handbags worth thrice your monthly income.

This is not overthinking or anything abnormal, but very natural. Shaped by trauma, amplified by its aftermath. But letting mental health take a backseat for more money isn't a wise choice at all. Still there needs a tradeoff to be done secure something in the bank.
