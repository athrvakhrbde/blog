I've been going out with my colleages, to bars, clubs and restaurants, but I never feel included and there's no one else to blame other than me becasue it's upto everyone to participate in the whole vibe, and no one owes me special treatment.

This doesn't just happen with them, even when I go out with friends of my acquaintances, the same thing repeats.

I feel so bored and alienated (not by them, by myself), that I'd do anything to leave that place just to go elsewhere and get bored there. 

It becomes really awkward too. I literally have nothing to do. Sometimes, there are forced that keep me there, but I wish I was elsewhere. 

I start acting really weird, so much so that people with me first ask me whether I'm ok, and try to make me comfortable, and it ends with, fuck it, he doesn't care, why should we, and there's no one else blamed to be, cuz I know there's something wrong with me.
