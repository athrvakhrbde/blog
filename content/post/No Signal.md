I was in class 7 or 8 when I fell for someone, becasue of the stupid goodbyes she used to bid from her bus after school ends. 

Almost more than half a decade later, I started understanding the signals. All she wanted was to mess with guys by giving them hope. 

Fuck it, fast forward to present, idk whether this gurl is friendly with everyone or something, but all my fukin bandwidth goes into assessing whether she treats others specially or is good with everyone or has a boyfriend secretly, whatever tf, the conclusion is I'm no one for her but heart wants to stay in hope and it fucks with my head all  the  time. 

My mind stats so occupied in collecting, processing, dejecting, etc all the (imaginary) hints and signals. 

Coping mechanism for chronic loneliness is what I consider it as. 

In short, I'm fucked either way. FML.
