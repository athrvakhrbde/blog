Two weeks ago I started re-learning (had started in college, didn't complete) HTML and CSS to hardcode my personal website, which has been on my wishlist since more than one year, but I could never gather enough motivation to pull it off, until now it was hosted on WIX. 

As mentioned on the site, I wanted it to a public showcase of my second brain with private info removed. Also, I wanted the site to be full of resources that might help others, covering a wide range of topics.

Amidst depression, doing this thing was such a relief. I've been sitting in the office from morning 8 to night 10 and "coding" in long stretches. That trance was something else. Such a meditative state to be in.

Now that my website build has completed, I don't have anything to work on which I can be really proud of. Yesterday was an occasion when I worked all day with Hisham and enjoyed it, we've been working on mock renderings for the Ultrahuman Ring launch.

Coming back to hardcoding the website, I've tried to make it minimal and timeless, "web1" feels.

Hope my site help people with resources.

Next stop, T3T (Tier 3 Thrive).
