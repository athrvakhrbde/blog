## How motivational speakers are harmful ft. Toxic Positivity

Yesterday, on Instagram, I posted a story "roasting" India's most famous self-help guru/motivational speaker, Sandeep Maheshwari. My DMs got flooded with people defending him. But one DM was super interesting. 

The message read, "you can disagree, but you shouldn't disrespect, this guy is going his best and helping people selflessly."

Agreed. But there's a saying in Marathi, "फुकटला महाग", which translates to "something that's expensive even when you get it for free."

When I was in JEE coaching institute, 2 motivational speakers came to "motivate" the students. They were exact typical, Sandeep Maheshwari type guys. They told us that they wanted to help people and motivation is their passion. And I'm not saying this mockingly, they meant it. And I admire their sincerity towards helping people. I still genuinely believe that they wanted to help people, because they helped homeless and poor people too.

So, coming back to the motivational session, it was basically a brainwashing session on how you can become successful only by getting into IITs, otherwise your life is trash.

I was in deep shit back then. After the session, the motivational speakers individually talked to students. It was Christmas eve. A lot of students were waiting to talk to him. I wanted to talk to him about something that I couldn't share in front of anyone. Hence I waited for more than 2 hours. A "friend" of mine waited with me. He lived outside the city, he missed the last bus to his place to stay back with me until I finish the talk. 

So, only we 3 were there, nobody else. I told all of my problems to him. We kept talking for like 3 hours maybe? Don't remember exactly. And the motivation guy stayed back too, for me, and I'm grateful for that too. 

After listening whatever I told to the motivational speaker, my friend was scared to the limit that only thing left was shitting in his pants. 

To all of my ailments, the motivational speaker's solutions were, quote;

\- I understand what you're going through is tough, but you're not the only one suffering in the world. Everyone goes through sufferings and pain. This what life is all about. You need to be strong. It's 12 am now, else I would've taken you to slums, to the people I've helped, who have lost everything, don't even have anything to eat, on the other side, you are studying in an institute which has fee in lakhs. You have good food and a paying guest room. Your sufferings are nothing in front of theirs.

\- Draw a tree, with huge fruits on it, and inside each fruit, write all the things you're good at (we did that exercise there itself, the book, I still have. So we came up with all the things that I was good at, like swimming, skating, chess, sketching, etc.)

\- Now write what all you wanna do in life, buy your parents stuff. Buy yourself a supercar, everything, and use these affirmations to "manifest" whatever you want. 

\- You are a gem, you truly are, believe me (he then pulls out his phone), see, what I've saved your number as (reads "Atharva Reso Gem"). You're a gem, you just need to remove dust from you. Study harder. 

Unquote. 

Motivational talk ends. Me and my friend go to my room. Friend still shit scared, goes back to his place. 

I was in severe clinical depression back then, which was diagnosed months later. 

The motivational talk, in reality was peak toxic positivity. What is that? It's your homework. 

The motivation guy's intentions were totally good, and he wanted to help. He was passionate about it. I don't doubt it. 

So, now I hope you must've understood what "फुकटला महाग" really means.  

I know people think that, "Ah this guy just wants to hate everyone", "he just wants a chance to badmouth Sadhguru, etc."

No brother, this thing is deeper than what you see in a <280 characters tweet. 

I don't usually do gyanchodi, and I'm not doing it here too, I've just stated my experience, you'll take away the moral if you're mature enough.  

And what would've been the cost of this toxically positive motivational talk? Maybe someone's life, and you wouldn't even know that person ever existed.
