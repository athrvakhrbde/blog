I'm really clueless about my life, the world and myself. 

I don't know how these people talk so much on Clubhouse and all, I don't even have anything to talk about from a point of authority or advice. 

I feel like I was born yesterday. What I can do is have a discussion. Normal talks where I share my raw thoughts and am open to new ideas and perspectives. 

I'm constantly figuring out my life, its path/trajectory. 

At the same time I'm learning about the world itself. 

How there are memes that are really funny and offensive. 

And how there are people whose lives are ruined by trolls. 

How there is power and influence amongst few individuals. 

And how there are various populations of oppressed people. 

And so on.

I love it when my perspectives are contradicted, views are questioned and beliefs are shattered.
