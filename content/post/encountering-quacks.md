My experience with pseudoscientists has never been good. Pseudoscientists I met, range from just having no scientific temperament (for eg. the people who were vouching for plasma therapy in a raging pandemic wave), to pseudoscientific extremists. 

As I had mentioned earlier, I was kicked out of the hostel's WhatsApp group I had been living in for calling Ayurveda pseudoscience. 

In India, major types of pseudoscientists are religious (extremists) & scientifically illiterate. 

I majorly talk against Ayurveda and Homeopathy cuz they're the type of pseudosciences that can literally cost you your life (our family friend died the same way, and my close friend is in later stage of thyroid cancer, both of them took homeopathy (former guy) and Ayurveda (latter one) remedies thus ending up being dead and in ICU respectively)

I don't talk about pseudosciences like Astrology, etc cuz it's not life threatening.

I got so much hate just for stating scientific evidence against quackeries lime Ayurveda and Homeopathy that I had reached a point where I was thinking, "fuck people, let them die of their stupidity." But then I remember what Dr. Abby Philips has said, "We are doctors and we've taken the oath to save our patients' lives no matter how irrational or stupid they are. We won't give up on them."

I left the biggest project of my life yet because of core team members having strong pseudoscientific beliefs which was closely related to their ego. That's what happens with cults.

I don't have any extremist friends, neither do I hang around any, nor should you. I have 1 friend, but as I said, even after a lot of explanation and trial, his cancer advanced  cuz of not taking modern medical treatment and purely relying on Ayurveda.
